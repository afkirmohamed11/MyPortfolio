    duration: "(Jun 2024 - Sep 2024)",
    details:
"I worked as a Data Engineer at Shiftbricks, a start-up where I developed a data pipeline based on the Medallion architecture (bronze, silver, and gold layers) to process arabic legal documents. This pipeline extracted and structured metadata and content from PDFs using OCR, LLM models, and other techniques, converting them into a JSON schema for storage in MongoDB. The structured content was then embedded for use in an AI assistant chatbot. The entire process was automated using Airflow and included a human validation step via a FARM stack UI, where experts validated the document structure before embedding. Dealing with arabic content throughout this process added an extra layer of complexity, particularly in areas such as OCR and text processing, making the project both challenging and rewarding."  }
